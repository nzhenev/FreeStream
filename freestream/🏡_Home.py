    The first chatbot made for FreeStream was RAGbot. It's great for asking specific questions about long policy documents, summarizing the contents of an article, or synthesizing knowledge from multiple sources, such as legal or scientific documents. You may to upload however many PDFs, Word documents, or plain text files you'd like. You can then pose specific questions directly related to the content of your documents.

        1. Upload Documents:  Upload your documents to RAGbot.
        
        2. Document Splitting:  RAGbot splits your documents into chunks for further processing.
        
        3. Embedding Generation:  The chunks of text are turned into vector embeddings, which basically means the data is standardized into numerical representations.
        
        4. Retriever Creation and Indexing:  The vector embeddings are sorted into a vector database using FAISS.
        
        5. Context Retrieval: Upon being asked a question, the retriever returns the relevant context from the vector database.
        
        6. Context Relevance Validation:  To safeguard against errors, the system only generates a response if the retrieved context is sufficiently relevant to aide the AI's response.
        
        7. Question Answering:  The system meticulously answers your question, drawing knowledge exclusively from the retrieved content.

    Curie is perfect for venting your thoughts, getting constructive feedback on something you wrote, helping you make sense of things. Plus you don't have to upload any files. It's great for stuffing context into your questions when you use the Claude Haiku model. Specifically, it's been told to actively assist users in comprehending reality using their curiousity and critical thinking skills. It has a tendency to nudge you towards answers rather than giving them away, which is great for learning.
